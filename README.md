# Cracking the Coding Interview

In an attempt to keep busy while job hunting, and to stay on top of my CS knowledge,
I'm going through Cracking the Coding Interview and solving (most) of the technical questions.

This will be (mostly) livestreamed at: [twitch.tv/jeremydwayne](https://www.twitch.tv/jeremydwayne)

But, instead of doing this in a language I'm familiar with like C, C++, Java, or Ruby; I'm going
to do this in Python. Python is a language I've been meaning to learn, but haven't had a reason to till now.
Hopefully by the end of these exercises my knowledge from other languages will be translated into this
strange language that likes to be picky about indentations!
